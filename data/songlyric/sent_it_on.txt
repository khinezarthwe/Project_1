A words just a word
Til you mean what you say
And love isnt love
Til you give it away
Weve all got a gift
Yeah, something to give
To make a change
Send it on, on and on
Just one hand can heal another
Be a part, reach a heart
Just one spark starts a fire
With one little action
The chain reaction will never stop
Make it strong
Shine a light, and send it on
Just smile, and the world
Will smile along with you
That small act of love
Is meant for one who become two
If we take the chances
To change circumstances
Imagine all we can do
If we send it on, on and on
Just one hand can heal another
Be a part, reach a heart
Just one spark starts a fire
With one little action
The chain reaction will never stop
Make it strong
Shine a light, and send it on
Send it on, ooh, send it on
Theres power in all
Of the choices we make
So Im starting now
Theres not a moment to waste
A words just word
Til you mean what you say
And love isnt love
Til you give it away
Send it on, on and on
Just one hand can heal another
Be a part, reach a heart
Just one spark starts a fire
With one little action
The chain reaction will never stop
Make it strong
Shine a light, and send it on
Send it on, on and on
Just one hand can heal another
Be a part, reach a heart
Just one spark starts a fire
With one little action
The chain reaction will help things start
Make it strong
Shine a light, and send it on
Shine a light, and send it on
Shine a light, and send it on
