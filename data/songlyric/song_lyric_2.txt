What day is it? And in what month?
This clock never seemed so alive
I cant keep up and I cant back down
Ive been losing so much time
Cause its you and me and all of the people with nothing to do, nothing to lose
And its you and me and all of the people
And I dont know why I cant keep my eyes off of you
All of the things that I want to say just arent coming out right
Im tripping on words
You got my head spinning
I dont know where to go from here
Cause its you and me and all of the people with nothing to do, nothing to prove
And its you and me and all of the people
And I dont know why I cant keep my eyes off of you
Something about you now
I cant quite figure out
Everything she does is beautiful
Everything she does is right
Cause its you and me and all of the people with nothing to do, nothing to lose
And its you and me and all of the people
And I dont know why I cant keep my eyes off of you
And me and all of the people with nothing to do and nothing to prove
And its you and me and all of the people
And I dont know why I cant keep my eyes off of you
What day is it?
And in what month?
This clock never seemed so alive
